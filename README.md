# Rust Redis

This is a rust replica of some of the functionalities that Redis has.
This is a project for me learning Rust, it is not meant to be used in production and I do not represent neither the Rust Project or Redis.


## Todo
- [ ] Add helpfull error message for syntax errors
- [ ] Separate into client and serverside
- [ ] add a list keys command 
- [ ] add metrics (either statsd or cloudwatch?)
- [ ] add logging to file
